# 🕵️‍♂️ Facial Attribute Analysis with Mask Detection
![Facial Attribute Analysis with Mask Detection](/cover_images/cover_image_raw.png)


## 🔍 Overview
In the domain of facial recognition, our project stands out by integrating mask detection with deep learning-powered facial attribute analysis. We tackle the contemporary issue of obscured facial features due to mask-wearing, ensuring our algorithm remains effective in today’s mask-prevalent society. Our solution, utilizing the advanced InceptionV3 architecture along with the comprehensive DeepFace library, is capable of identifying faces in a variety of settings, discerning masked from unmasked individuals, and further analyzing unmasked faces for age, gender, race, and emotion.


## 🎯 Objectives
The key milestones in our project included:
* **Mask Detection Model Development:** Developing a model to identify if faces in images are masked, using our dataset and InceptionV3's transfer learning capabilities for enhanced accuracy.
* **Facial Analysis with Mask Detection Integration:** Combining mask detection with DeepFace-driven facial analysis to accurately annotate unmasked faces with attributes such as age, gender, race, and emotion.
* **Real-World Application Demo:** Showcasing the model's effectiveness in a real-world scenario, demonstrating facial analysis and mask detection on a sample video.
